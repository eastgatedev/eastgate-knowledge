# Knowledge Base

This repository is my structured knowledge base.

It consolidates selected work from my public videos and long-form thinking,
organized for clarity, structure, and long-term reference.

This repository is not a content archive.
It is a structured system of judgement, design, and implementation.

## Purpose

Modern platforms optimize for speed and visibility.
This repository optimizes for clarity and structure.

Videos communicate ideas.
Markdown preserves them.

The objective is to:

- Preserve structured thinking
- Make decisions searchable
- Standardise implementation knowledge
- Maintain long-term reference value

---

## Structure

The repository is divided into three primary layers:

### 01 — Judgement
High-level thinking on:
- AI and professional value
- Responsibility and pricing
- Career structure
- System philosophy

This layer answers: **Why**

---

### 02 — Systems
Architecture-level documentation:
- Wallet system design
- B2B structures
- Risk boundaries
- Backend responsibility models

This layer answers: **How it should be designed**

---

### 03 — Implementation
Practical and reproducible materials:
- Structured video notes
- Setup guides
- Environment standards
- Technical walkthroughs

If complex code is required, it is referenced via dedicated repositories.
This repository focuses on explanation and structure.

This layer answers: **How it is executed**

---

## Format

Each video-related document includes:

- Title
- Direct YouTube link
- Structured Markdown notes
- Key decisions
- Implementation references (if applicable)

Markdown replaces slides.
Clarity replaces decoration.

---

## Standardisation Principle

Documents follow consistent patterns.
Standardisation reduces ambiguity.
Structure is preferred over novelty.

Repetition is intentional.

---

## Philosophy

Technology evolves.
Frameworks change.
Tools rise and fall.

Judgement and responsibility remain.

This repository tracks how decisions are made,
how systems are designed,
and how implementation is standardised.
