## Context

This episode extends the discussion from execution compression
into pricing and commercial structure.

It explains why faster code generation does not automatically
translate into lower software cost.



## Objective

To clarify the difference between execution cost and responsibility cost.

To redefine what clients are actually paying for.



## Core Argument

Clients are not paying for code.

They are paying for:

- Clarity
- Structure
- Risk management
- Stability
- Accountability

AI reduces execution cost.
It does not reduce responsibility cost.



## Structural Breakdown

AI accelerates:

- Code generation
- Boilerplate scaffolding
- Draft implementation

But after code is generated, the real work begins:

- System boundary definition
- Security validation
- Failure handling
- Deployment architecture
- Monitoring and observability
- Long-term maintenance strategy

These layers define production responsibility.



## Risk Ownership

When systems go live:

- Financial errors have consequences
- Data corruption has consequences
- Security breaches have consequences
- Compliance failures have consequences

AI does not absorb consequence.

Humans do.

Pricing reflects risk ownership,
not typing speed.



## B2B Perspective

In B2B environments:

You are not selling code.

You are selling accountability.

AI changes workflow efficiency.
It does not eliminate liability.



## Key Judgement

Execution becomes cheaper.

Responsibility does not.

Software pricing is anchored to risk,
not generation speed.
